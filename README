hi. i'm jp. 
i'm a geek whose into anything software related. my passion is for programming and i try to learn as much about it as possible. 
i received my bs in computer information systems from rhode island college, and recently finished my masters in software engineering from southern methodist university.
currently i am working as a freelance developer, doing rails, node.js and php development for jakeandco, metryx, schwadesign, achievery, and others.

my previous full-time gig was all in java and gosu (jvm stuff), which i did for ~6 years.
